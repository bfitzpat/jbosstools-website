== BPEL Editor
=== The Business Process editor

image::images/features-bpel-editor-ui.png[]

The BPEL editor supports the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), an XML based language defined by the http://www.oasis-open.org[*OASIS Consortium*].
BPEL uses Web services standards to describe business process activities as Web services, defining how they can be composed to accomplish specific tasks.

JBoss BPEL is based on WS-BPEL 2.0, and provides a way to create, edit, validate and deploy BPEL files to
the JBoss BPEL runtime.

JBoss BPEL extends the Eclipse BPEL Designer project with the following enhancements:

* Close integration with JBoss, and adds a new project type for deployment to the JBoss BPEL runtime.
* Supports two deployment methods. The first method is to deploy a BPEL project directly to the JBoss BPEL runtime. The second method is to deploy BPEL files in JBoss ESB project to the JBoss BPEL runtime.
* Enhances the BPEL validator and improves the quality of the Eclipse BPEL editor.
